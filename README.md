### Description

A way to track budgets entered by the user to show a graph of the 'total over time'. The goal of this assignment was to use service-worker and Mongodb to ensure any data entered while offline still gets added to the database when reconnected.


### Installation

Fork or copy the repo and run 'npm install' to get all necessary packages. Then run 'npm start' to run the server and in your browser go to 'localhost:3000'. 


### Constributions

None


### Testing

Open the link to the application in your browser (tested in Firefox and Chrome), add some inputs. Then open the browsers dev tools and set to offline mode and add a few more entries. Reconnect the page and refresh. If successful the entries added while offline should remain and be added to the database
